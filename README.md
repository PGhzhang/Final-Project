# Final-Project



## Scroll Master

### Team: Hanyu Zhang, Yiyuan Feng

### Project Idea

For final project, we are building a social media feed scrolling helper. With this helper system, users can scroll social media feeds using body gestures.

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between human beings and technology, especially mobile devices. People today spend too much time on their phones. Researche shows that the average person spend over 4 hours on his/her phone each day. Thus, we want to create an interactive device that let users view their phones while getting some exercises done.

The system will leverage PoseNet by Tensorflow to analyze pose data that is captured by a webcam. The pose data is then used to control a mechanical arm, which interact with the phone accordingly. For example, if user put his/her arms up, the mechanical arm will scroll up the social media feed.
