# Final-Project



## Scroll Master--Carmen

### Team: Hanyu Zhang, Yiyuan Feng

In this final project, we designed a facebook feed scrolling helper--Carmen. Carmen is consisted of body gesture recognization technology and a mechanical arm.
Users can control the arm to scroll up, scroll down by looking up/down, left/put down their arm. 
What we want to express in this project is the relationship between people and phone or technology. When you simply use your finger to go through
the facebook feed, it's not you are controlling the device but the device is controlling you. You just can't stop and have to receive the information from social media statically.
While you are using Carmen, your big body gesture is remind you of the real world and tell you that you should be the man to controll the device in you hand.
